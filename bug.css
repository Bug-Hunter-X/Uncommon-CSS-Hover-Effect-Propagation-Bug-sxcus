The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where the hover effect on a button is unexpectedly applied to the parent div element as well:

```css
div {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}

button {
  background-color: lightcoral;
  padding: 10px 20px;
}

button:hover {
  background-color: darkred; 
}
```

The hover effect is unintentionally expanding to the parent `div` due to a possible lack of specificity in the CSS selector.  This is an uncommon bug because it is highly context-dependent and often masked by other CSS rules or the browser's default styling behavior.
