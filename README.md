# Uncommon CSS Hover Effect Propagation Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in CSS where a hover effect on a button unintentionally applies to its parent div element.

The `bug.css` file contains the buggy CSS code. The `bugSolution.css` file provides a corrected version.

This is often caused by CSS specificity issues and can be difficult to debug unless carefully examining the CSS cascade.
